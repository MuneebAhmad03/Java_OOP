This repository is dedicated to exploring and illustrating the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It delves into the fundamental concepts of **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction** through practical Java code examples and clear explanations. Whether you're new to OOP or seeking to deepen your understanding of these essential paradigms, this repository provides a focused resource. Each section explores a specific OOP concept with accompanying code to demonstrate its implementation and benefits in Java. Dive in to master the art of designing modular, reusable, and maintainable software through object-oriented principles. Contributions and suggestions for clarifying these concepts further are welcome
